# Carried Debt

Items known and not scheduled. Re-check that an item is still true before
starting on it, and delete it here when it stops being. Every item below was
re-confirmed against the tree on 2026-08-09, each against the `file:line` it now
names; four were restated because the surface had moved under them. Confirmed is
not scheduled, and a later reader owes the same re-check.

Work that belongs to the standing goal lives in
[release-guard-reachability.md](release-guard-reachability.md), not here.
Everything else not listed is owned by the comment at the site and by
[gates.md](gates.md).

- **CI runs macOS but proves no install there.** `check.yml`'s `check-native` leg
  and the release lane's `darwin-arm64` build both set
  `require_platform_proofs: "0"`, and `test/platform-proof.mjs` grants a non-skip
  only on `linux`/`x64`, so every installed-binary and installer proof self-skips
  on macOS. Do not "fix" this by flipping the flag — requiring it across all of
  `linux-*` is what burned `ceal-v0.67.0`.
- **Two published acceptance records overstate guide registration, and one leaks
  identity refs.** `docs/acceptance/ceal-v0.69.0/` and `ceal-v0.67.1/` were
  emitted while `registered_host_count` counted resolved host directories rather
  than registrations, and `ceal-v0.69.0/linux-amd64.yaml` carries
  `membership_ref` and `subject_ref` from the pre-`.v2` emitter. Both emitters are
  fixed; the records are historical artifacts and were left as written rather
  than rewritten after the fact. Anyone re-publishing them owes a re-emit, not an
  edit.
